# Bhagavad Geeta

The Bhagavad Gita, often referred to simply as the Gita, is a 700-verse Hindu scripture that is part of the Indian epic Mahabharata. It is written in the form of a dialogue between Prince Arjuna and the god Krishna, who serves as his charioteer. This conversation takes place on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, just before the start of a great war.
